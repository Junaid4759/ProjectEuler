This repository contains my solutions to the problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). Project Euler is a collection of challenging mathematical and computational problems that require creative problem-solving skills. Each problem is designed to be solved with computer programming.

## About Project Euler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the problems are designed to be solved using a computer program. The problems range in difficulty and cover various mathematical and computational concepts.
